## Overview
Applied Mathematics course is for the first-year students in the faculty of commerce - Menoufia University, and the main goal is to introduce the students to probability, matrix algebra, solving linear system of equations, and some real commercial applications.

### First Topic: Probability
The first topic is probability, which includes def-inition of statistical experiment, sample space, events, probability of events, and finally rules of the probabil-ity. Based on that, we introduce the contingency tables as applications for probability.

### Second Topic: Matrix algebra and solving linear equations
The second topic is matrix algebra and solving linear equations. In this topic, we introduce first ma-trix operations including matrix transpose, matrices addition/subtraction, matrices multiplication, and final-ly determinant. After that, we introduce how to find the matrix inverse, and how to solve linear equations using matric inverse. Finally, in this topic, we introduce the row reduction method to find the matrix inverse and to solve linear equations, and many examples of real life problems and how they can be formulated as system of equations.
