## Overview
Applied Mathematics course is for the first-year students in the faculty of commerce - Menoufia University, and the main goal is to introduce the students to probability, matrix algebra, solving linear system of equations, and some real commercial applications.

### First Topic: Probability
The first topic is probability, which includes def-inition of statistical experiment, sample space, events, probability of events, and finally rules of the probabil-ity. Based on that, we introduce the contingency tables as applications for probability.
