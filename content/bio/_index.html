<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> General Background</h1>
<p>I am an <strong>Associate Professor of Statistics</strong> (since October 2020) at <a href = "http://www.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en">Faculty of Commerce, Menoufia University, Egypt</a>. Before that, I worked as an Assistant Professor of Statistics from September 2015 to September 2020 at <a href = "http://www.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en">Faculty of Commerce, Menoufia University, Egypt</a>. In addition, I worked as a Tutor for Statistics and Mathematics from February 2012 to June 2014 at <a href = "http://www.swin.edu.au/">Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia</a>. Moreover, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for Statistics and Mathematics from May 2007 to April 2010 at <a href = "http://www.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en">Faculty of Commerce, Menoufia University, Egypt</a>. I was awarded my PhD degree from <a href = "http://www.swin.edu.au/">Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia</a> (in January 2014). I received my MSC in Statistics (with excellent degree in October 2009) and BSC in Statistics and Social Science Computing (with excellent degree in June 2006) from <a href = "http://www.feps.eun.eg/">Faculty of Economics and Political Science (FEPS), Cairo University</a>, Egypt.</p>
<p>My research work is mainly in time series analysis and forecasting methods. In my <em>Master study</em>, I proposed a Bayesian inference for multiplicative seasonal ARMA models by implementing MCMC Gibbs sampling algorithm. In addition in my <em>PhD study</em>, I continued my work in time series analysis but mostly in the real application of time series forecasting. In particular, I was working on proposing an automated statistical approach to forecasting Quality attributes of software systems. These Quality attributes include performance, reliability, and availability. This forecasting approach is mainly based on linear and non-linear time series models and wavelet analysis. Currently, I am mainly working on modeling <em>multiple seasonalities</em> aiming to propose a new efficient forecasting method that can be effectively applied in different research fields such as finance, economics and software engineering.</p>
<p>I deliver statistical consultations for many clients such as regional projects, companies, and postgraduate students in different fields including information technology, social and educational sciences, linguistics, and medicine that require the statistical analysis and data mining as a main component in their work.</p>

<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Prof. Lars Grunske and Dr. Alan Colman</p>
<p><strong>Area of Study:</strong> Quantitative Analysis for Quality Attributes of Software Systems</p>
<p><strong>Thesis Abstract:</strong> This study proposes a collection of automated forecasting approaches for quality of service (QoS) attributes of Web services. Each one of these approaches is able to fit and forecast a specific type of QoS stochastic characteristics, however, taken together they will be able to fit different dynamic behaviors of QoS attributes and forecast their future values. In particular, the thesis proposes an automated forecasting approach for nonlinearly dependent QoS attributes, two automated forecasting approaches for linearly dependent QoS attributes with volatility clustering, and two automated forecasting approaches for nonlinearly dependent QoS attributes with volatility clustering. The accuracy and performance of the proposed forecasting approaches are evaluated and compared to those of the baseline ARIMA time series models using real-world QoS datasets of Web services characterized by nonlinearity and volatility clustering. The evaluation results show that each one of the proposed forecasting approaches outperforms the baseline ARIMA models.</p>

<p><strong>Thesis Topic:</strong> Bayesian Inference for Seasonal ARMA Models: A Gibbs Sampling Approach</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Prof. Mohamed Ismail and Prof. Emad Soliman</p>
<p><strong>Area of Study:</strong> Bayesian Time Series Analysis</p>
<p><strong>Thesis Abstract:</strong> This study develops a Bayesian inference for multiplicative seasonal ARMA model by implementing a fast, easy and accurate MCMC Gibbs sampling algorithm. The proposed algorithm does not involve any Metropolis-Hastings generation but is generated from normal and inverse gamma distributions. The proposed algorithm is illustrated using simulated examples and real datasets.</p>
