abstract = "In this paper, we present a Bayesian methodology to identify the order of DSAR models. Assuming the model errors are normally distributed and using three priors, i.e. natural conjugate, g, and Jeffreysâ€™ priors, on the model parameters, we derive the joint posterior mass function of the model order in a closed-form. Accordingly, the posterior mass function can be investigated and the best order of DSAR model is chosen as a value with the highest posterior probability for the time series being analyzed."
